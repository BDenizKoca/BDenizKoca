# Welcome

I'm Deniz, a curious mind exploring AI, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), Flutter-Dart, and Python. Not a programmer by trade, but I enjoy tinkering with code and building little projects for fun.

I build tiny, useful things – web apps, extensions, and scripts.  
All open source, all working demos.

## Interests

- **Artificial Intelligence** – Experimenting with AI-driven tools and applications  
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** – Exploring modern web technologies  
- **Flutter & Dart** – Learning to build cross-platform apps  
- **Python** – Writing small scripts and automating tasks  
- **Game & Media Design** – Worldbuilding, storytelling, and interactive media  

## Currently Exploring
- Building AI-assisted tools with Python  
- Developing simple mobile apps with Flutter  
- Experimenting with automation and data analysis
